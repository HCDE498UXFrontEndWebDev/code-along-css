      <h2 class="postTitle">My trip to Padelford</h2>

      <p>
        I got lost trying to go to a TA's office hours in
        Padelford, an old and confusing building on UW's campus.

<section class = "history">
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Padelford was built in the 1960's with an intentionally jarring layout
        so that protestors could not easily congregate within the building. The
        unpleasant design of padelford continues to annoy students looking for
        math TA's to this day.

      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      <p>For English 111, you are required to meet with your teacher and go over your final portfolio before turining it in. I walked into Padeflrod through the front entrance. I went to the left to find the elevator. Once in the elevator, I went to the third floor. Once on the third floor, I walked around for 10 minutes after realizing I had no clue where my Ta's office was. I finally found the office at the back end corner of the building.</p>
